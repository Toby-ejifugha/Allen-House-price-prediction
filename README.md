# Allen-House-price-prediction

A real estate agent is in charge of selling a new house in Allen Texas, but he doesn't know the price. I want to infer it by comparing it with other houses. I look at 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in the area. At the end of the day, what I want is a formula for all these features which gives me the price of the house, or at least an estimate for it. To help my client sell the new house.
